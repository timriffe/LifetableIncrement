LifetableIncrement
==================
This repository contains the laxtex file for a paper submission titled "The force of mortality by life lived is the force of increment by life
left in stationary populations". I've gotten into the habit of keeping such things on github, especially as my laptop ages, but 
also so as not to lose track of changes made. If further revisions are made, these will be incorporated here. This repo will like stay simple, 
as the paper contains no calculations at this time.
